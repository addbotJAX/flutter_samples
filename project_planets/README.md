# project_planets

I did not include the build folder because it has a very large size. When creating apps in flutter, build folder will be automatically
build for the project. Images folder for the planets has also not been included because of its size. Create the images folder separately
and look at the pubspec.yaml for guide purposes on how import asset images to the folder.
